      <p>Rather than focusing on what is not possible during this time of uncertainty, dreamscape emphasizes the potential for the emergence of new and diverse ideas as we adapt to the global pandemic.
        Though the work is diverse in many ways, all projects are a testament to our capacity to overcome obstacles and dream of new ways-of-being. Our projects consist of a variety of topics which include identity, social issues, mental health, and
        much more. Some of the mediums our projects encompass are data visualization, visual and auditory experience, digital paintings, digital video, virtual space, game, and web art.</p>

      <p>Gallery 2: The feelings of Quarantine. Surviving during a pandemic is stressful. We experience many emotions ranging from
        anxiety, frustration, loneliness, uncertainty, restlessness, depression, etc. You are not alone. Everyone around the world
        will experience something like this during this lockdown. Personally, I have felt lost in an isolated routine. My main source
        of production are my zoom calls. After a while those can get pretty tiresome while our camera reflects our image back to us
        creating a hyper-aware environment. When I'm not on zoom I must keep myself entertained. This is when I turn to my imagination
        and try to get creative, although I find it hard to be inspired during this time. I have displayed these everyday struggles
        abstractly through animation shorts that I have created in After Effects. Walk inside my virtual gallery room to discover the
        two panels of quarantine feelings.</p>
