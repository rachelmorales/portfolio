  <h5>Artist Statement</h5>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="column">
      <p>My name is Rachel Morales and I am a graduate student from San Jose State
        University with a BFA in Digital Media Art. I have transferred here from West Valley
        Community College where I graduated with my AA in Liberal Arts. I study web
        development, 3d modeling, motion graphics, 2d design, and computer processing. I create
        most of my work through Adobe Applications such as Illustrator, Photoshop, After Effects,
        and Premiere. I code in Atom and a p5 editor as well as create 3d works in Maya.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="column">
      <p>Art allows people to express themselves through the process and discover more
        about who they are as an end result. The more I create, the more I figure out my place in
        the world and gain a sense of purpose and self-identity. During these times, I find myself
        clinging to the freedom that digital creation provides me and many others. One day I hope
        to be part of the teams that create these new forms of technical communication that help
        the world go round.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="column">
      <p>I have many strengths that keep me successful with my own work. I always stay
        organized while I am creating digital work as well as in everyday life which keeps me
        punctual and reliable. My attention to detail and patience for tedious work would benefit
        any team. I am a team player and work well in group settings because I find it very useful
        and productive to have active voices and different opinions brainstorming the task at hand.
        Group settings also provide me with constructive criticism and feedback on my work. I
        have had many job opportunities that gave me customer service experience which I am
        now very familiar with and well-adjusted to. These people skills help me converse with
        others and come to agreements while transforming customer visions into the real thing!</p>
