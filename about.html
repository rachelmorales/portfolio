  <h5>Artist Statement</h5>

  <div class="about_section">
    <div class="about">
      <p>I am currently studying at San Jose State University for my Digital Media Art BFA. I have
        transferred here from West Valley Community College where I graduated with my AA in Liberal Arts.
        During my days at West Valley I learned the basics for programs such as Atom, Illustrator, Photoshop,
        Premiere, and Animate, Processing, and Maya. I also did hands on creation during 2d and 3d design,
        ceramics, and drawing classes. Once I got to San Jose State University I had accumulated
        quite a bit of finished digital pieces that have made it into my portfolio.</p>

    <div class="about">
      <p>My work is mostly digital because I find a sense of freedom in creating with technology where the
        possibilities are endless. I usually incorporate images from the web into my creations or I scan hand
        drawn images that I have made and digitally recreate them. I keep a natural color aesthetic within all
        my pieces and add textures as to not make my work seem too flat. When starting to create new pieces I
        pull inspiration from my passions and feelings in life and create personable pieces. If given the
        opportunity, I make interactive pieces that get people to uncover a deeper meaning. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="about">
      <p>I have many strengths that have helped me acquire those experiences as well as keep me successful with
        my own work. I always stay organized while I am creating digital work as well as in everyday life which
        keeps me punctual and reliable. My attention to detail and patience for tedious work would benefit any team.
        I am a team player and work well in group settings for I find it very useful and productive to have active
        voices and different opinions brainstorming the task at hand. Group settings also provide me with
        constructive criticism and feedback on my work.</p>
